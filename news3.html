								<p>The government of Uzbekistan continues its irreconcilable fight against corruption in the educational sphere. This was noted by Sherzod Kudbiyev, adviser to the President of Uzbekistan, at a press conference on the fight against corruption in the higher education system. The event took place on November 5 at the Tashkent State University of Economics.</p>

								<p>&ldquo;If we do not take decisive steps in the system of higher education now, then we will never achieve change in this area!</p>

								<p>Negative phenomena can also be seen at the Tashkent State University of Economics.</p>

								<p>Unfortunately, the University&rsquo;s leadership and its staff did not achieve the results that our people and the president expected from them. Corruption in assessing students&rsquo; knowledge, transferring them from course to course, expelling from the student ranks, and restoring again is still present.</p>

								<p>We will mercilessly fight corruption! As the president said, there is no way back, all bridges have been burned.</p>

								<p>Leaders will either serve the people or leave. And they&rsquo;ll leave for a reason. This can be judged by the composition of today&rsquo;s presidium.</p>

								<p>With leaders, who do not serve the people and abuse their powers, we will never be able to work. They will be deservedly punished.</p>

								<p>You should keep in mind that today studies in the field of higher education are ongoing, you will still hear about their results, the most stringent measures will be taken!&rdquo; Kudbiyev said.</p>

								<p>It should be recalled that at a meeting on November 5, the rector of TSUE Bakhodir Khodiyev was relieved of his post, and Kongratbay Sharipov, the First Deputy Minister of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education, replaced him.</p>
